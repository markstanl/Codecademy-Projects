# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a very simple form of regression. ML is used to find some function for some real-world output. Consider some dataset graphed, linear regression is simply trying to find the line of best fit on that graph, using the old data. We are trying to find the best slope and intercept in a dataset to find the best line $y=mx+b$

# K-Nearest Neighbor
The K-nearest Neighbor algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that attempts to group up similar data points by calculating the "distance."
This can be visualized in 2D with two features, and in 3D with three. The formula for the distance is as follows
$$d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-x_i)^2}$$

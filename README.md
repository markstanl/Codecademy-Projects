# Codecademy Projects
As a pro user of Codecademy, I am often required to make a project to move on with the course. This repository contains 
all of my coded projects, in multiple fields. There are likely multiple courses in each src folder, so dive in. 
Each main directory is either a Courses folder or a career path folder. The career paths are the 
large job-training courses, which each warrant their own directory. The course folders are all filled
with all the smaller courses that teach me a specific skill in the wider coding world.
